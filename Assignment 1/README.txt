To run experiments and produce all graphs for the Red Wine and Telescope datasets, respectively, download all files in the link above and run:

python3 redwine-binary.py

python3 telescope.py

You will need to have scikit-learn, matplotlib, numpy, and pandas installed. Also, please note that generating all graphs may take quite some time.

Code formatting the CVGridSearch output was reproduced from the scikit-learn website 
        (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/model_selection/plot_grid_search_digits.html).

Code for plotting the learning curves was reproduced from the scikit-learn website 
        (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/model_selection/plot_learning_curve.html).

Code for creating two y-axes on the same graph was reproduced from the matplotlib website 
        (https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/subplots_axes_and_figures/two_scales.html).

Code for plotting the validation curves was reproduced from the scikit-learn website
        (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/model_selection/plot_validation_curve.html).
